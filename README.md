# COMSOL multiphysics simulation for speed-up effect in channels

Supplementary information for paper "Density dependent speed-up of particle transport in channels"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06448

Models are saved without solutions to reduce file size. Just run solve on the current solver to recover typical solution. 

File `Speed-up_revised_2018.mph` includes all three simulation types but is rather complicated. Therefore, I advise looking into the specific models first. 


## Requrements

Tested on COMSOL Multiphysics version 4.4
